This project implements Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers on the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle to predict the presence of heart disease based on medical attributes. The workflow includes loading and preprocessing data, training a Decision Tree (with overfitting control using max_depth) and a Random Forest, evaluating models using accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and 5-fold cross-validation, as well as visualizing decision trees and feature importances. Results show that Random Forest achieves slightly higher accuracy and is less prone to overfitting compared to a single Decision Tree. Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and optionally Graphviz for tree visualization.
